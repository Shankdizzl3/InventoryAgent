This document outlines the project plan for creating a local LLM agent designed to proactively audit and fix inventory integration issues. It details the architecture, technical decisions, and the phased approach for development.

### **1\. Project Vision & Objective**

The core objective is to move beyond a reactive support model and build a proactive, autonomous agent that acts as a continuous auditor for the company's inventory system. The agent will:

* **Identify Errors:** Proactively scan the system for inventory discrepancies (e.g., negative quantities, stuck transactions, data mismatches).  
* **Troubleshoot:** Use a defined workflow and a set of tools (APIs) to diagnose the root cause of an error.  
* **Resolve:** Execute API calls to correct data, flip status bits, and re-process transactions to fix the detected issues.  
* **Report:** Log all actions and resolutions for auditing and oversight.

### **2\. Agent's High-Level Workflow**

The agent will operate as a continuous, proactive auditor, following a multi-step, iterative process without direct human intervention for each task. The workflow is designed to ensure a logical and reliable path from detection to resolution.

* **Auditor Mode:** The agent initiates a scan of the company's parts and transactions by retrieving data through its tools. It continuously looks for new data to process.  
* **Detection Mode:** The agent analyzes the retrieved data against a set of predefined rules to identify any discrepancies or errors, such as negative quantities or transactions stuck in a pending state.  
* **Troubleshooting Mode:** When an error is found, the agent enters a diagnostic phase. It uses its tools to gather more information and pinpoint the root cause of the problem.  
* **Action Mode:** The agent selects and executes the appropriate tool calls (APIs) to fix the diagnosed issue, such as adjusting a quantity or flipping a transaction status bit.  
* **Validation Mode:** After taking action, the agent re-runs a check to confirm that the problem has been successfully resolved. If the issue persists, it will either re-enter the troubleshooting loop or escalate the issue for human review.

### **3\. Architectural Decisions**

The project's architecture was designed to meet two key constraints: a limited budget and the use of a CPU-only server environment.

* **Inference Engine:** The agent's "brain" is a **local, CPU-based LLM**. We will use **llama.cpp** as the high-performance C++ engine to run the model efficiently on the server's CPU. This approach avoids the need for expensive, dedicated GPU hardware.  
* **LLM Model:** The chosen model is **Phi-3 Mini (3.8B)**. This model is small enough to run on a machine with 16GB of RAM and has a powerful reasoning capability suitable for this task. It will be used in a **quantized GGUF format** to maximize performance on the CPU.  
* **Agentic Workflow:** A **Python** script will serve as the high-level orchestrator. It will communicate with the llama.cpp server via an API endpoint, acting as the "client" that sends prompts and receives responses. The Python code will also contain the logic for pulling data, calling external tools, and managing the agent's workflow.  
* **Tooling:** The agent will use a set of custom APIs to interact with the inventory system. These APIs are defined as "tools" for the LLM.

### **4\. LLM Training & Specialization**

To ensure the LLM is a reliable, expert agent for the inventory system, we will use fine-tuning instead of relying on a general-purpose model.

* **Methodology:** We will perform **instruction-based fine-tuning** using a technique called **QLoRA**. This is a memory-efficient method that allows us to train the model on a specialized dataset without requiring a powerful GPU for the entire process.  
* **Dataset:** We will create a custom dataset that serves as the "inventory playbook." Each data point will be a JSON object that teaches the model how to reason and act.  
  * **instruction**: The agent's core mission statement.  
  * **input**: A simulated system report or error log.  
  * **output**: The model's ideal response, including a **Chain of Thought (CoT)** analysis and a sequence of structured **tool calls** (e.g., adjust\_quantity(...)).  
* **Fine-Tuning Environment:** Fine-tuning a model on a CPU is not practical due to the time and resource requirements. Therefore, we will perform the fine-tuning on a separate computer with a powerful GPU or leverage a short-term, cost-effective cloud GPU rental.

### **5\. Implementation Phase**

The project will follow a phased approach:

* **Phase 1: Setup and Validation**  
  * **Status:** Complete.  
  * **Work:** The llama.cpp project has been successfully built on a Windows machine. The Phi-3 Mini model has been downloaded and validated to run on the CPU.  
* **Phase 2: Agentic Loop Development**  
  * **Objective:** Establish the Python-to-C++ server communication.  
  * **Action:** Use llama-server.exe to expose an API endpoint. Write a Python client to send prompts and receive responses.  
* **Phase 3: Data Curation & Fine-Tuning**  
  * **Objective:** Create the specialized "inventory playbook" dataset.  
  * **Action:** Create 50-200 high-quality JSON examples of inventory problems and their solutions.  
  * **Action:** Fine-tune the Phi-3 Mini model on this dataset using a GPU-enabled machine.  
* **Phase 4: Tool Integration**  
  * **Objective:** Integrate the fine-tuned model with the custom APIs.  
  * **Action:** Build the Python logic that parses the model's structured output and dynamically calls the correct tool with the specified parameters.

### **6\. Critical Considerations for Enterprise Deployment**

This section addresses key aspects of moving from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready system.

* **Data Security and Privacy:** While the local LLM architecture enhances data privacy, the system will still handle sensitive inventory data. We will implement the **Principle of Least Privilege** for all API credentials, ensuring the agent's access is restricted to only what is necessary for its function. A plan for **secure log storage and rotation** will be established to prevent sensitive information from being exposed. Any data used for fine-tuning will be meticulously **anonymized** and scrubbed of any personally identifiable information (PII) before it is used for training.  
* **Monitoring and Oversight:** An autonomous agent requires robust monitoring. A dashboard or logging system will be created to track key metrics like success rates and resolution times. This system will include a clear **escalation plan** to flag unresolved issues for human review, ensuring a **Human-in-the-Loop** approach.  
* **Versioning and Reproducibility:** To manage the project effectively, all components will be versioned. This includes the Python scripts, fine-tuning datasets, and the model files themselves. This practice allows for easy rollbacks and ensures the project is reproducible and maintainable over time.
